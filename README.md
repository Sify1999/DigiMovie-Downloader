# 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository:**  
git clone https://github.com/Sify1999/DigiMovie-Downloader.git
cd movie-downloader

2. **Create a virtual environment:**  
python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**  
**Windows:**  
venv\Scripts\activate  

**Linux/Mac:**  
source venv/bin/activate

4. **Install dependencies:**  
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Prepare your HTML file:**  
- Open the webpage you want to extract links from and save it manually as file.html.  
- Place file.html in the project folder (next to main.py).  

6. **Run the script:**  
python main.py

7. **Follow the prompts:**  
- Select the video quality you want.  
- Choose whether to add links to IDM.  
- Optionally start the download immediately.  

# 📝 Notes
- Make sure IDM is installed and the path is correctly set in main.py.  
- The script currently works on **Windows only** because it interacts with IDM and uses pyautogui.  
- Generated files like links.txt and virtual environment folders (venv/, env/) are ignored in the repository.
